# Chronic Back Pain: 6 Reasons Men Are Choosing Planking Over PT and Painkillers

PT gets the method right. But the cost, the commute, and the schedule make it impossible to stick with. Here's what's replacing it.

**#1: Weak Core, Bad Back. Fix One, Fix Both.**

Your back hurts because your core is too weak to support your spine.
That's what PT fixes. Planking does the same thing.
Same muscles, same fix. At home, in 3 minutes.

**#2: PT: $200/Session. Pure Plank: $149. Total.**

PT runs $150 to $200 per session, 2x/week, for months.

**#3: PT Works Until You Stop. 3 Minutes Is Too Easy to Quit.**

Most people stop going to PT. When they do, the pain comes back.
Pure Plank is 3 minutes on your floor. No appointment, no commute.
Nothing to quit because there's barely anything to do.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**I have a herniated disc. Is this safe?**
Planking is one of the most recommended core exercises for back pain because it strengthens without compressing the spine. That said, check with your doctor before starting any new exercise if you have a diagnosed spinal condition.

**How long until the back pain gets better?**
Many reviewers report feeling a difference within the first week. One reviewer said, "Within a week I noticed a big difference in my back." Results vary, but the core strengthening that reduces back pain starts immediately.

**I can barely hold a plank for 15 seconds. Can I use this?**
Yes. Jay Reso, one of the founders, started at 30 seconds, and he was a professional athlete. The app has beginner routines starting at 15-second holds. You start where you are.

**What makes this better than planking on the floor?**
The cushioned padding removes the elbow and wrist pain that makes most people quit floor planks within seconds. The handles keep your form locked. The timer tracks your progress. It turns planking from something you try once into something you actually do daily.

**What if it doesn't work for me?**
Lifetime warranty. The founders use it every day themselves. They stand behind it.
